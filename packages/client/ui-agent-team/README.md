# @saturnai/dsh-client-ui-agent-team

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package adds an Agent Teams action to the Web conversation header, where a user can inspect the current roster, manage the shared task board, and navigate into a teammate's conversation. It reads authoritative Team state through the generated `ctx.remote.agentTeams` contribution and keeps ordinary child-history navigation on the stable addressed-subagent path. Choose it for a Web composition that mounts the Agent Teams layer: the shipped `@saturnai/dsh-web-app` bundle mounts it by default, and `@saturnai/dsh-agent-team-web-profile` mounts it for base-backed profiles. Mount exactly one of those two, because a Web composition that mounts both declares the same Loader entry id twice. The browser projection does not extend the stable API Proxy, store Team state, or register model-facing input.

## Use this package

The shipped `@saturnai/dsh-web-app` bundle mounts the package directly; a base-backed profile mounts it through [`@saturnai/dsh-agent-team-web-profile`](../../bundle/agent-team-web-profile/README.md) after the Host-side Agent Teams layer. Do not mount both, and do not mount the Web profile layer over `dsh-web-app`. The Web Client loader mounts the `/client` export; the root Host export is inert, and the package has no user configuration fields.

### Inspect and navigate the roster

Opening the panel calls `agentTeams/view`. Roster rows show durable names, runtime status, model, and diagnostics. Selecting a healthy teammate refreshes the existing direct-child catalog and opens the ordinary `{ parentSessionId, childSessionId, mode: 'continuable' }` address. History and later human prompts continue through the stable addressed-subagent conversation path; this package adds no Team-specific address field.

### Manage the task board

The task board shows task identity, owner, blockers, readiness, advisory write scopes, and overlap warnings. A user can create, edit, assign or unassign, complete, reopen, and delete tasks through `agentTeams/createTask` and `agentTeams/updateTask`. Every update sends the displayed revision, and create or update rejections remain explicit business results.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The Client export mounts the generated `ctx.remote.agentTeams` contribution from [`@saturnai/dsh-agent-team/remote`](../../saturn/agent-team/README.md), then registers its locale dictionaries and one conversation-header slot through Cordis effects. Disposing the plugin fiber removes both registrations.

Starting a create or update invalidates older refreshes. Success reloads the complete Team view so every task's derived fields stay current. A `team-task-conflict` result displays a stale-state notice only after that reload succeeds; a reload failure remains visible instead. Editing task text or scopes and changing dependencies use two sequential compare-and-set mutations because the Team service exposes them as separate actions.

## Further Exploration

- [Agent Teams Web profile](../../bundle/agent-team-web-profile/README.md) — the source-checkout bundle that mounts this Client plugin.
- [Agent Teams service](../../saturn/agent-team/README.md) — authoritative roster, task, and Remote behavior.
- [Conversation UI](../../client/ui-conversation/README.md) — the stable header slot and addressed-subagent navigation surface.
- [Promotion record](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-18-experimental-agent-teams-packages.md) — placement, release family, and dependency isolation.

## Model Experience

None, as this browser projection and task control surface registers no model-facing input.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; the Team tools and ordinary conversation submission own any later model-visible use.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Snapshot refresh** — the panel refreshes on open, explicit refresh, and mutations; it has no live event subscription or mailbox timeline.
- **Ordinary child continuation** — a human message sent after navigation uses the stable addressed-subagent prompt path, not the Team peer mailbox.
- **No lifecycle or workspace controls** — the panel cannot spawn, rename, delete, or interrupt teammates, and write scopes remain advisory metadata.

### Dev Note

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. RPC is authoritative and the package owns only one disposable slot registration.
